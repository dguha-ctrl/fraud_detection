# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection System (XGBoost + Anomaly Models)

This project implements a **hybrid fraud detection system** that combines a fine-tuned XGBoost model with anomaly detection techniques like **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**. 

---

##  Features

- Supervised learning with **XGBoost**
- Unsupervised anomaly detection via **Isolation Forest** and **LOF**
- Hybrid model using weighted ensemble of predictions
- Dynamic feature engineering (velocity, flags, time-of-day)
